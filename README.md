# Safe Workout
Determine whether or not it's safe to work out outside, based on 
Tejas Richard's formula of outdoor temperature plus dewpoint, 
with a sum of 150 (F) or greater being unsafe to work out 
outside.

This will be a pretty useless app, at first - you'll have to input
the temperature and dew point manually, but I hope to automate
that by adding geo-ip capability. 

Will this be the app that fulfills my goal of writing a semi-legit
go app by the end of the year? Stay tuned!
